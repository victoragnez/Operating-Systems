# Operating-Systems
Repository used to develop and store projects for Operating Systems classes.

The first one (t1) is responsible for watching the process tree and detect possible fork bombs, exporting the tree in a json file, and showing the number of active process grouped by user.
It was developed in both C++ and Python languages.

The second (t2) watches the CPU usage and sends different signals to a BeagleBone Black device, turning on LEDs to show the current status. Developed in C++.

The third (t3) simulates a Pong game, controlled by the BeagleBone, using buttons and potentiometers. Developed in C++.

The fourth (t4) is similar to the t3 project, but it's a client-server application, which uses sockets to communicate. The client was developed in Pyhton and the Server in C++.

The fifth (t5) is a memory manager, which watches, shows and exports the memory usage informations. Developed in C++.

The sixth (t6) is a client-server application for a Snake game, which supports multiple snakes running at the same time from different computers, supporting concurrent accesses. Developed in C++.
